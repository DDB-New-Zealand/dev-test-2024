# Senior Frontend Developer Technical Test

This task evaluates your skills in **React**, **Next.js**, **Typescript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **animation libraries** like **GSAP** or **Framer Motion**. Build a small application that fetches data from a public API and presents it with engaging animations and a responsive UI.

## Project Requirements

### Tech Stack:
- **React with Next.js**
- **Typescript**
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** for animations

### Features:
1. Fetch data from a public API (e.g., [Free Test API](https://freetestapi.com/apis)).
2. Display a structured, user-friendly list of fetched data on the home page.
3. Implement filtering or search functionality for refining the list.
4. Create a detail page for each item (using Next.js dynamic routes) and display additional data.

### Extra Points:
- Implement loading states (e.g., spinners or skeleton loaders).
- Add up to two types of animations (e.g., element appearance, interaction, transitions).
- Deploy the application (e.g., using **Vercel**) and provide a live link.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository locally. Install dependencies with **Node.js**. Refer to [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) or the README.md for setup details.

### Advanced Features:

1. **Data Fetching & Optimization:**
    - Implement error handling and user feedback for failed API calls (e.g., retry options).

2. **State Management:**
    - Use Redux or Zustand for global state management. Persist state to `localStorage`.

3. **Advanced Filtering & Search:**
    - Implement multi-criteria filtering, sorting, and search with debouncing to optimize performance.

4. **Animations:**
    - Ensure advanced, performant animations without impacting responsiveness.

5. **Code Quality:**
    - Enforce code consistency using ESLint and Prettier.
    - Add comprehensive tests where appropriate.
